# Operators in python

xplus = 15 + 6  # + operator for adding numbers

xm = 14 - 6  # - operator for subtracting numbers

xz = 2 * 8   # * operator for multiplying numbers

xt = 8 / 2  # / operator for dividing numbers

xtkh = 12 // 2  # // operator for floored division

xtb = 8 % 2  # % operator for modulus

yt = 2** 3  # ** operator for exponents




# Comparison operators

'Their answer is always boolean'

b = 50 > 40  # The number 50 is greater than 40

k = 78 < 100  # The number 78 is smaller than 100

bm = b >= 8  # b is greater than or equal to 8

km = b <= 7  # b is smaller than or equal to 7

m = b == k  # b is equal to k

nm = b != k  # b is not equal to k




# Logical operators

'If both are true the answer is True otherwise is False'

and_ = (b < m) and (m == k)  # and 

s = True  # not
print (not s)

xl = (m > 3) or (4 > 6)  # or




# Assignment operators

e = 8   # = operator is for direct assignment 

e += 59  # += operator is for addition assignment

e -= 65  # -= operator is for subtraction and assignment

e *= 45  # *= operator is for multiplication and assignment

e /= 56  # /= operator is for division and assignment

e //= 45  # //= operator is for floored division and assignment

e %= 2 # %= operator is for modulus and assignment

e **= 5  # ** operator is for exponents and assignment




# Identity operators

sh = m is e  # To check if two objects are the same

shn = m is not e  # To check if two objects are not the same




# Membership operators

oz = 5 in [7,8,9,5]  # To check membership

ozn = 4 [5,6,9,8]  # To check non membership
